# etch-a-sketch

This project is a mix of a whiteboard and an [Etch-a-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) board, completely built using raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Functionalities are simple: when you hover over the blank whiteboard, squares will become black, creating a painting. If you want to reset the painting or to change the size of each square, it can be done with the RESET button.

It features the following:

- Use of semantic HTML
- Use of CSS Grid layouts
- Custom CSS variables and fonts
- DOM Manipulation in JS

This project was created as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) bootcamp.
